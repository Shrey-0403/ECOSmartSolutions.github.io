<p>      Light-emitting diode (LED) is today’s most energy-efficient lighting technology.  LED lights last six times longer than other type of lights, reducing the requirement for frequent replacements, and lowering the  carbon emissions. Many of the parts and components can be re-used as lighting or recycled to be used in another way.<br><br>
    By Implementing the LED lights in your house, you will be able to reduce the power consumption of your house, in turn reducing your carbon footprint!

<p>Water consumption of most households is one of the leading consumers of energy in most households. To reduce water consumption of your household you can implement a tankless water heater<br><br>Tankless water heaters only heat as much water as you need, this on-demand heating makes the units more energy efficient. The tankless water heaters are 24%-34% more efficient than the conventional storage tank water heaters. Additionally, these tanks burn less natural gas per gallon of hot water and therefore reduce carbon emissions.<br><br>

  <p> Along with water usage, home appliances such as the stove, the washing machine, the dryer, and the microwave all consume a ton of power. Utilization of modern more efficient appliances can help reduce power consumption, resulting in a lower carbon footprint.<br><br> Modern appliances have been designed to optimize energy usage while still providing the same level of functionality as its older counterparts. They are certified to be energy efficient by committees like Energy Star and use up to 40% less energy than their older counterparts. This results in more energy being available for other applications.

                Wind turbines harness the power of the wind to generate energy. Wind turbines have kinetic energy when they spin, and a generator behind the blades of a turbine converts the kinetic energy into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy. The electricity is  then transmitted through power lines to homes, businesses, and industries for various applications, including lighting, heating, cooling, and powering appliances and machinery.

                Solar panels are devices that use photovoltaic panels (PV) to convert sunlight into electricity to power homes.  Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect which uses semiconductors and when a photon strikes the semiconductive material the energy is transferred to the electrons causing them to get excited. The amount of energy given to the electrons allows them to escape their atomic bonds generating a current as they move throughout the semiconductor. Solar panels are usually placed on the roofs of buildings to save space and achieve the maximum amount of sunlight.

                Geothermal heat pumps take heat energy from the ground and convert it into energy for a household,  when setting these pumps up, geothermal reservoirs are ideal. To harness the energy, drills are used to find the reservoir and it is classified whether it is a steam or hot water reservoir (This is due to the temperature and pressure making it either a liquid or gas).
2 specific types of geothermal heat plans are horizontal and vertical pump systems. Horizontal pump systems are for more rural areas and are dug 2 to 3 feet wide and 6-10 feet deep. Vertical systems are more narrow, they are at places where land is at a premium. They are typically 20 feet wide and 400 feet deep.

                <br>The Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) is a voluntary EPA program that tackles methane emissions from landfills. It works with waste management and industry folks to capture methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from decomposing waste. This captured methane can then be converted into clean energy for homes and businesses, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and combating climate change.

Biogas recovery also helps achieve other social, environmental, agricultural and economic benefits. AgSTAR assists those who enable, purchase or implement anaerobic digesters by identifying project benefits, risks, options and opportunities. AgSTAR provides information and organizes events to create a supporting environment for anaerobic digester implementation.

The goals of the Green Power Partnership are to "advance the American market for green power, encourage the development of new U.S.-based renewable electricity sources, reduce air emissions and pollution, recognize leadership and impact in green power use, and support basic market principles and practices that serve all U.S. electricity consumers."
